Hello World, I'm Rim 👋

### Analytical professionnel, Sport & Music Enthusiast Always

I've always loved exploring new places and trying different things. Over the years, I've practiced taekwondo, swimming, handball, and running before falling in love with catching waves whenever I'm near a coast 🏄‍♀️. When I'm not diving into data, I'm usually hiking, playing oud, or hunting for new songs, secretly dreaming of a future career as a DJ. I’d love to take on an Ironman competition one day (if my knees ever decide to cooperate with this plan).

### My Data Journey

I stumbled into the world of analytics by chance at OCP Group ( 🌱 the world’s largest producer of phosphate products) where I witnessed firsthand how data can transform business strategy and decision-making. That experience led me to pursue advanced studies in analytics at ESCP. I later joined Deutsche Bank’s quantitative risk team, working on AI-driven models to support risk analysis. 
I'm driven by understanding market dynamics and making decisions backed by data and analytics.
